Address    |    Value    |    Logical Role
-------------------------------------------
0x1008     %eax = 2      The function argument, which gets decremented down to 0
0x100c     %ebp = sp     The base pointer for the stack
0x1010     %eax = 1      The function argument, which gets decremented down to 0
0x1014     %ebp = sp     The base pointer for the stack
0x1018     %eax = 0      The function argument, which gets decremented down to 0
0x101c     %ebp = sp     The base pointer for the stack

after this point, we will jump to fact_return, where other things will happen (namely,
the stack will get popped and the answer will get calculated)

Key:
    * sp = stack pointer value

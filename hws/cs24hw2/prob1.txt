1) What does the following assembly code do?

movl 8(%ebp), %eax   # Moves a doubleword (4 byte) from M[8 + %ebp] into %eax.
imull $3, %eax       # 32-bit signed multiplication. Multiplies the constant 3 by the value in the %eax register, and stores it in the %eax register.
addl $12, %eax       # Adds the constant 12 to the contents of %eax.
imull 8(%ebp), %eax  # 32-bit signed multiplication. Multiplies M[8 + %ebp] by the value in the %eax register, and stores it in the %eax register.
subl $17, %eax       # Subtracts the constant 17 from the value in the %eax register and stores it in the %eax register.

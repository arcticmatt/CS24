Organizing free blocks:

keep linked list called p_list

initially, store pointer to mem

when myalloc is called, look through linked list of free blocks and try to
allocate to one of them. could possibly use best fit here. looks something like
the following:

for int i < size of p_list
    set variable curr = p_list[i] // curr is the ith block of free memory
    if (size <= (size of curr))   // size of curr should be stored in a header
        p_list.remove(i)
        int new_size = (size of curr) - size;
        if (new_size > 0)         // if after allocating memory to this free block there is still space,
                                  // push back a new free block to the linked list
            p_list.push_back(curr + size)

push function pointer onto stack, do call?
Using Box as an example...

pushl 8(%ebp) # Push function pointer, which is
              # float (*getVolume)(Box_Data *this)
              # as found in
              # Box_Class
call          # This will call the getVolume function, which will presumably
              # call ret to return back to the callee
popl          # Clean up the stack

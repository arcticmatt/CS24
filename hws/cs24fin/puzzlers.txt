===== Problem 1 =====

int counter = 0;

int main() {
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        fork();
        counter++;
        printf("counter = %d\n", counter);
    }
    printf("counter = %d\n", counter);
    return 0;
}

a)

The value of counter is printed 10 times. We see the every time through the
for-loop, fork() is called. This means every time through the for-loop, we
create a new child process. Thus, we get the following behavior:

The parent process prints 3 times, twice inside the for-loop and once outside.
This is normal behavior.

We get a child process spawned from the parent when i = 0.  This will print once
when i = 0. Then, it will spawn another child process when i = 1, print again in
the for-loop, and print once outside the for-loop. So that is 3 prints for this
child process.

    The child process spawned from this child process prints inside the for-loop
    when i = 1, then once outside the for-loop. So that is 2 prints for this
    child process.

We geta child process spawned from the parent when i = 1. This will print
once when i = 1, then once again outside the for-loop. So that is 2 prints for
this child process.

So overall we have 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10 prints.

b)

The value of counter printed in the first line is 1. This value is always
printed because after the first fork() and counter++, all running processes have
counter = 1. This is because each process sees its own copy of the variable.
So it doesn't matter which process prints; the value of counter will be 1.

c)

The value of counter printed in the last line is 2. This value is always printed
because in every process, the last print statement is the print statement
outside the for-loop (see answer to part a) for more detail). And at this point,
count is always 2 (again, because each process sees its own copy of the
variable). So no matter which process ends up finishing, this is the print
statement with which we will always end, and thus 2 will always be printed last.

===== Problem 2 =====

The output of this program is

counter = 1
counter = 3
counter = 3

and it is the same every single time.

What happens is the following:

First, we register handler1 for the signal SIGUSR1. We are currently in the
"parent" process (it's not really a parent yet, but it is about to be). So
handler1 is registered for this "parent" process.

Then, we have the line

if ((pid = fork()) == 0)

This generates a child process, in which pid = 0. We also still have our parent
process, in which pid != 0. The child process executes the "if" code
(because of the == 0) and the parent process executes the "else" code. We can
see that the parent process code will execute later because it waits for a state
change in its child before doing anything. So, let's get the child process code.
We can see that we register handler2 for the signal SIGUSR1. But then, we call
kill on the parent process to send it the signal SIGUSR1. Remember that the
first thing we did was register handler1 for SIGUSR1 in the parent process.
So that handler gets called here. Then we can see that counter gets incremented
and printed (in the parent process). That is where we get

counter = 1

from. Then, that handler calls kill(pid, SIGUSR1). Recall that we are now in the
parent process, which means that the pid here is the pid of the child process.
So when we call kill with SIGUSR1, the code for handler2 executes. Then, we have
that counter gets incremented by 3 in the child process (in which counter is
still 0). That is where we get

counter = 3

from. Then, handler2 calls exit, which causes the child process to terminate. So
clearly now the status of the child process has changed. Thus, wait(&status)
will return a nonnegative value, and the parent process code in the else
statement will proceed. In the parent process, counter at this point is at 1.
So when it gets incremented by 2 and printed,

counter = 3

gets printed. And so that's that.

===== Problem 3 =====

Let's go number by number. The first number that gets printed is 0. This always
happens. So, we start with

0

Then, we fork() off into parent and child processes. At this point, val is 2.
Here, since parent and child processes execute concurrently and their
execution is interleaved as determined by the kernel (lec 19, slide 24), two
possibilities arise. The first one is that the child process code can
execute first. In this case we get:

Case 1:
03

The second case is that the parent process code executes first. In this case we
get

Case 2:
01

Let's now consider Case 1. Here, the child process code executed first. So,
in one scenario, now the parent process code gets a chance to execute (in the
else statement) which gives us:

Case 1a:
031

Then, the parent process waits for the child process to change states. This
means the child process will execute until completion. So, val will be
incremented again outside the if/else and then printed, giving us

Case 1a:
0314

Then the child process exits. This means the parent process can continue. So
the parent process increments val outside the if/else and prints it, giving us

Case 1a:
03142

Let's go back to Case 1. It could also happen that the child process code just
keeps on running till completion, before the parent process code gets a chance
to execute at all. So after 03, we could get

Case 1b:
034

from the child process code outside the if/else. Then, the child process code
would terminate. Finally the parent process code would run, causing val to be
decremented to 1 and giving us the following print statement:

Case 1b:
0341

Then, wait would immediately return, because the child is already terminated,
so then we would just go to the code outside the if/else in the parent process,
giving us

Case 1b:
03412

That covers all the subsets of Case 1. Now, let's go back to Case 2. Here,
parent process code executed first. But now, since there is a wait in the parent
process code, the child process code must go to completion. So the only possible
scenario in this case is

Case 2:
01342


So overall, the outputs that COULD be generated by the program are

03142
03412
01342

========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?

We are assuming the page has already been mapped into the process' virtual
address space. So we can just call mprotect on the memory region of the page
with the prot parameter set to be PROT_NONE. Then, any access to the page will
cause a segfault to be generated. So that is how we will detect when it is
accessed.

b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?

We are assuming the page has already been mapped into the process' virtual
address space. So we can just call mprotect on the memory region of the page
with the prot parameter set to be PROT_READ. Then, any write to the page will
cause a segfault to be generated. So that is how we will detect when the page
becomes dirty (writing to a page modifies it and causes it to become dirty).

f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:


g)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000" using FIFO policy:


h)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000" using CLOCK/LRU policy:

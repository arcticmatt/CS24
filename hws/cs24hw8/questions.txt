Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?

We are assuming the page has already been mapped into the process' virtual
address space. So we can just call mprotect on the memory region of the page
with the prot parameter set to be PROT_NONE. Then, any access to the page will
cause a segfault to be generated. So, in short, if we get a segfault because
a page has its permissions set to be PROT_NONE, we know it is accessed.


b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?

We are assuming the page has already been mapped into the process' virtual
address space. So we can just call mprotect on the memory region of the page
with the prot parameter set to be PROT_READ. Then, any write to the page will
cause a segfault to be generated. So, in short, if we get a segfault because
a page has its permissions set to be PROT_READ, we know it is modified (becomes
dirty).


f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:
Run 1: 52794 page loads
Run 2: 53407 page loads
Run 3: 52626 page loads
Average: 52942.33 ~ 52942


g)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000" using FIFO policy:
47944 page loads


h)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000" using CLOCK/LRU policy:
Run 1: 6802 page loads
Run 2: 6834 page loads
Run 3: 6834 page loads
Average: 6823.33 ~ 6823
